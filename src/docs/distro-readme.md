# LinuxHub Distro README

LinuxHub is a desktop-friendly Linux experience focused on **simple package management**, **sensible defaults**, and **beautiful tooling** out of the box.

## Philosophy

- Keep the base system lean, predictable, and easy to maintain.
- Offer a curated set of applications for common workflows (development, media, productivity).
- Provide clear visibility into what the system is doing: updates, drivers, kernels, and background tasks.

## Package Management

- Built on top of the underlying distro package manager (e.g. pacman).
- The LinuxHub UI surfaces:
  - Installed and available applications.
  - Update state and queued operations.
  - Clear feedback when installs/updates succeed or fail.

## Configuration

- Dedicated panels for:
  - System information and hardware details.
  - Kernel management (including LTS and recommended kernels).
  - Updates, storage, devices, and more.

## Documentation

Use this **Documentation** section to:

- Quickly read the distro README (this page).
- Check release notes, version highlights, and known issues for your current build.
